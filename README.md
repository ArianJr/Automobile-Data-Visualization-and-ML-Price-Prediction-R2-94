# 🚗 Automobile Price Prediction with XGBoost

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict automobile prices using a dataset sourced from [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaya23abdul/automobile-database)). After thorough preprocessing and feature engineering, an XGBoost regression model was trained and achieved an **R² score of 0.94**, indicating strong predictive performance.
